A multistable mechanism is a specific mechanism able to hold more than one stable state with zero force. Multistable mechanism devices find application in valves, switches, closures and clasps. They needs to be able to store and release energy at specific positions. Bistable and multistable systems generally involves combination of springs and are attractive from multiple points of view as they can be small and scalable. \\
