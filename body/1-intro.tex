    Multistable systems are specific mechanism that can be positioned into different position or shape and only require energy to go from one position to an other position. When the structure is composed of few multistable structure, it is feasible to analyze and process the motion induced. When we add more multistable system, it become harder to predict the outcome of a specific input, and therefore it become inefficient to control a robot by hand. \\
    The goal of this project is to create a software platform that is simulating a robot composed of multistable legs. With the simulation we can then understand and process how the robot is performing under different parameters and finally design a controller.
